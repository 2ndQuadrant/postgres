PostgreSQL tests
================

This directory contains a variety of test infrastructure as well as some of the
tests in PostgreSQL. Not all tests are here - in particular, there are more in
individual contrib/ modules and in src/bin.

Not all these tests get run by "make check". Check src/test/Makefile to see
which tests get run automatically.

examples/
  demo programs for libpq that double as regression tests via "make check"

isolation/
  tests for concurrent behaviours at the SQL level

locale/
  sanity checks for locale data, encodings, etc

mb/
  tests for multibyte encoding (UTF-8) support

modules/
  extensions used only or mainly for test purposes, generally not useful
  or suitable for installing in production databases. Some of these have
  their own tests, some are used by tests elsewhere.

perl/
  infrastructure for Perl-based Test::More tests. There are no actual tests
  here, the code is used by other tests in src/bin/, contrib/ and in the
  subdirectories of src/test.

regress/
  PostgreSQL's main regression test suite, pg_regress

ssl/
  Tests to exercise and verify SSL certificate handling

thread/
  A thread-safety-testing utility used by configure, see its README
