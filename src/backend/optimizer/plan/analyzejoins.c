 *
 * While we do a great deal of join simplification in prep/prepjointree.c,
 * certain optimizations cannot be performed at that stage for lack of
 * detailed information about the query.  The routines here are invoked
 * after initsplan.c has done its work, and can do additional join removal
 * and simplification steps based on the information extracted.  The penalty
 * is that we have to work harder to clean up after ourselves when we modify
 * the query, since the derived data structures have to be updated too.
